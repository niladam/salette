**Salette** is a port of the [Saloon](https://github.com/saloonphp/saloon) PHP package, tailored specifically for legacy applications that require PHP 7.4 compatibility.

This package exists with **permission from the original author [Sam Carr√©](https://github.com/Sammyjo20)** and aims to mirror and ensure the functionality and developer experience of **Saloon** as closely as possible within the limitations of PHP 7.4.

> [!TIP]
> If your application uses **PHP 8.0 or higher**, you should use the [official Saloon package](https://github.com/saloonphp/saloon) instead.


## What is Salette?

Salette helps you build clean, reusable **API integrations** and SDKs in **PHP 7.4**, in the same way you would do using Saloon.

It organizes your requests into structured classes, centralizing your API logic and making your codebase more maintainable.

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate a Working Example

The fastest way to get started is to generate a ready-to-use integration:

```bash
php vendor/niladam/salette/examples/create-integration.php
```

Or, in code:

```php
use Salette\Helpers\Stub;

Stub::create(); // Instantly creates a JsonPlaceholder integration you can use and modify
```

This will create:
- `app/Http/Integrations/JsonPlaceholder/JsonPlaceholderConnector.php`
- `app/Http/Integrations/JsonPlaceholder/Requests/GetPostsRequest.php`
- `app/Http/Integrations/JsonPlaceholder/Requests/CreatePostRequest.php`

You can use these classes right away, and just change the URL, endpoints, or request bodies to match your API.

### 2. Using Your Integration

```php
use App\Http\Integrations\JsonPlaceholder\JsonPlaceholderConnector;
use App\Http\Integrations\JsonPlaceholder\Requests\GetPostsRequest;
use App\Http\Integrations\JsonPlaceholder\Requests\CreatePostRequest;

$connector = new JsonPlaceholderConnector();

// GET /posts
$response = $connector->send(new GetPostsRequest());
$data = $response->json();

// POST /posts
$response = $connector->send(new CreatePostRequest());
$data = $response->json();
```
